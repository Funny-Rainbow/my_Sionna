# Sionna 0.19.0

## Installation
**!!! Native Windows Does Not Support NVIDIA GPU Acceleration !!!**  
Sionna requires Tensorflow>=2.13. However, starting in TF 2.11, CUDA build is not supported for Windows.

Possible Solution:
Docker container
Use earlier version of TF, which is not recommanded because of known, unpatched CVEs.
Use WSL
